Hello Indiana!

# Getting started with Git Lab
## Instructions
In this lab, we'll be going through some basic tasks you'll need to do as you manage the GitHub repository for your CollectionBuilder site. The questions below are designed to help you learn and remember what you need to do to perform these tasks, as well as where you can go to look for help. 
## Creating your repository and editing files
**What did you click on to create a new repository in the web interface of Github (i.e., on Github.com)?**  
In the web interface, from my Github homepage, I can press the green button with a bookmarked book icon labeled "New."

**What is the difference between a private and a public repository?**  
Anyone can view a public repository, while you manage who can view a private one.

**Once your repository has been made and has at least one file, what button do you need to click on the web interface in order to create a new file in your repository?**  
The "Add File" button.

**Describe the steps you took to clone your repository on Github Desktop**  
I opened the "file" tab and then hit the "clone repository" option, selected "markdown-playground," and then confirmed I wanted to clone it.

**What is the title of GitHub documentation?**  
A README file.

**What is the URL for GitHub documentation on creating your first repository?**  
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories

**Where is your local repository versus the remote repository?**  
My local repository is located on my personal computer, while the remote repository is in GitHub's cloud (or, much more broadly, as being "somewhere else" *not* on my PC acc. to the glossary document).

**What happens when you fetch?**  
from docs.github.com: "When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Unlike git pull, fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch."

**What happens when you pull changes/commits?**  
from docs.github.com: "Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date."

**When working on GitHub Desktop, what order should you generally perform push, pull, and fetch?**
First fetch, then pull the content, then push your edits back to GitHub.

**What happens when you push commits from your local repository?**  
You're making your saved/committed changes to the repository available remotely, from the cloud. 

**What is the URL for the Github glossary?**  
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary

**Where can you find a list of your commits?**  
https://github.com/elarte-iu/markdown-playground/commits/main

**What is the URL for documentation on reverting a commit?**  
https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-revert

**How do you revert a commit?**  
You revert them with `git revert.`

## Git-flavored markdown
**What is the name of the page or URL in GitHub documentation where there's information on how to format your Markdown for GitHub?**  
[Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

**What precedes a second-level heading in Github markdown?**  
Two hashtags, ##

**How do you indicate text that has been struckthrough?**  
surround the text with two tildes on each side ~~like this~~

**How do you create a hyperlink in your markdown?**  


**How do you link to a section in the same or another markdown file?**  


**What are the three possible symbols for indicating an unordered list?**  
an asterisk, a dash, or a plus sign. (*, -, +)

**Format the following text into a footnote:**  
Main text: Alex Wingate went to William and Mary.(place footnote here)  
Footnote text: William and Mary is a university in Williamsburg, VA founded in 1693.  
Bonus: make "William and Mary" a hyperlink to W&M's website.
