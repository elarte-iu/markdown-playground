# Z652 Digital Libraries
## Project Proposal Form


**Your Name:**  Elizabeth Arterberry

**Project Name:** Selections from J.K. Lilly's *Notable Medical Books* Collection


1.	**Describe your project.**  
For my final project for the *Digital Libraries* course, I intend to begin creating a "showcase repository" containing additional information about the books on medicine from J.K. Lilly's collection that are spotlit in the *Notable Medical Books from the Lilly Library*. Each item in the repository will bear an image of the cover of the book, basic metadata relevant to the user (such as but not limited to: Title, Author, Date, Publisher, Call Number, IUCAT link where applicable), **and** a more detailed description, most of which will heavily be pulled from the aforementioned reference guide, but additional sources may be consulted and subsequently cited. The goal is to provide visitors to this digital repository with engaging information about the significance of each manuscript, in particular noting their impact on the development of the practice of medicine and how this innovation and/or its creator was regarded at the time.

2.	**Describe the significance of this project.  Will this project complement or enhance other existing resources? Include links to related and complementary resources.**  
When completed (I intend to keep working past the initial 24 entries made for this course), this repository should serve as a helpful "stopgap" collection page until Cataloguing is able to put all the books mentioned in the *Notable Medical Books from the Lilly Library* guide published back in the 70s on IUCAT. Additionally, it will allow for historical context and interesting facts from the book to be provided, which IUCAT entries generally don't have the fields to contain, and wouldn't to keep the entries from getting bloated/veering from the purpose of helping individuals *find* the books. It will likely complement other medical book collections that IU has compiled, such as the Bushong-Beasley Dermatology Collection. 

3.	**Describe the target audience(s) for this project, current and potential users.**  
The potential audience for this collection is vast, ranging from medical researchers and historians from a wide variety of fields (the collection encompasses several disciplines that fall under the heading of "Medicine" and "Surgery") to library-goers who are gennerally curious about its collections. Thus, though the language I use may need to be discipline-specific in certain circumstances, I will endeavor to make it as easy to understand for those without an extensive medical vocabulary as is possible, such as providing definitions of terms or non-graphic examples of a concept if necessary. 

4.	**Describe types (media) of materials to be digitized and the number of each type (e.g. 12 letters (31 pages total); 14 photographs; 1 audio tape).  Include format, condition, and any special handling requirements.**  
24 books; the covers of each will be digitized; standout anatomical illustrations may additionally be digitized if time allows. Many of these books are *extremely* old (1600s-1800s), and I am not in the digitization department, so if I am not able to digitize these books myself, I will opt to make their lives as easy as possible for helping me with this task. 

5.	If the items to be digitized are held by an institution (e.g., IU Libraries, IU Archives of Traditional Music, Monroe County Historical Society), explain your collaboration and agreement with the institution for conducting this project.

6.	**Do you have any existing descriptive information (i.e., metadata) that could be used for searching these materials? What descriptive information do you currently have (e.g., title, creator, date)? In what form does this descriptive information exist (on paper, in a Word document, in an Excel file, etc.)**  A few of the books in this collection have entries in IUCAT, so I can get some inspiration for my metadata scheme from it. Also, I developed my own scheme for work this past summer while working on drafting a finding aid for the Bushong-Beasley Dermatology Collection, so I will likely draw from that as well. 

7.	**Describe your personal interest in and possible contribution to this project.**  
Having put a lot of effort into reassembling this collection for my job, I would love to help it recieve greater appreciation by the public. I think creating a digital repository like this can bring attention to the books in a fun and effective way, and it might also be a valuable experiment for the Lilly if they decide they want other collections or exhibitions put online in such a format in the future. 

8.	**Other general comments, issues or concerns.**  My main concern is how much I'll be able to get digitized while relying on someone else; placeholder images may be necessary, depending on how much demand is placed on the Lilly's digitization department. Thus, hopefully it's understandable if a few of the visual representations of my items turn out to simply be JPEGs/scans from a phone. 

9.	Indicate copyright status. Please refer to Cornellâ€™s Copyright Information Center (https://copyright.cornell.edu/ and especially https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain) for information to help you determine the copyright status of your materials.  Below, please explain your understanding of the copyright status of the material.

- [ ] Public domain
- [ ] Owned and controlled by you 
- [ ] Owned by someone else, but permission secured
- [x] Situation unknown or unclear 

**Copyright explanation:** The books are the Lilly's property; I need to discuss with my boss whether the Lilly family still has the ultimate say over what's done with the books in that collection. The books themselves (aside from a few published in the 1930s/40s) are well out of copyright, so they should otherwise be public domain.
